# MyCollection
Here are some materials I use and have created for internal purposes.

Welcome to my Collection for home lab automation repository! This collection of Ansible playbooks, scripts and compose files is designed to automate various aspects of my home network and server infrastructure.

## What's Inside

* **Ansible Playbooks:**
    * These playbooks automate the configuration of my servers, including:
        * Software installation and updates.
        * User management.
        * Network configurations.
        * Service deployment (e.g., Docker, media servers).
    * The goal is to maintain a consistent and reproducible setup.
* **Custom Scripts:**
    * You'll also find various shell and Python scripts for tasks that are not easily automated with Ansible.
    * Examples might include:
        * Backup routines.
        * Monitoring scripts.
        * Specific configurations for certain devices.
* **Docker Compose Files for Portainer:**
    * Various Compose files which are used on my docker structure
* **Jenkins Pipelines:**
    * Various Jenkins Pipelines to automate Backend Jobs

## Technology Stack

* **Semaphore Ansible:** The primary tool for infrastructure as code
* **Docker:** For containerized applications
* **Proxmix:** For Server Structure
* **Synology:** For my central Storage
* **Gitea:** For all my code
* **Jenkins:** For central management of jobs with multiple steps
